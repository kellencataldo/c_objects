# Introduction

## Forward

This course is designed for people who are already familiar with C or C++. 
If this is not the case for you, I strongly advise you get more experience 
with C/C++ as this course operates on the assumption that fundamental C 
concepts are understood. If this is not the case for you, feel free to 
continue.

## About

This course will teach you how to replicate object oriented design 
functionality in the C language. I highly doubt that anything in here 
will be of any practical use, as if object orientation is necessary in a 
project you are using, it would be more worthwhile to simply use C++. 
However, what I hope this course will do, is give a better understanding 
of what is going on "under the hood" of some object orientated languages. 

## Structure

This course will walk through the four fundamental concepts of object 
orientated design (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance) 
and how these can be implemented in C manually. This course will also 
include a library containing many basic data structure objects which 
have been implemented such as linked lists, strings, binary search trees, 
heaps, etc.
